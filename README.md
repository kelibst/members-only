# Member Only

In this project, we ’ll be building an exclusive clubhouse where your members can write embarrassing posts about non-members. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is but, outside, they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it. [Microverse](https:www.microverse.org/) - @microverseinc
